# Parkinson-s-MLR-model-Project
Sixteen biomedical voice measurements for detecting Parkinson’s disease (PD) symptoms were obtained from data collected by Tsanas et al. (2010); ten were identified as relevant for this project. 
Forty-two individuals were recruited to a six-month trial of a remote telemonitoring device program to determine the progression of PD symptoms. 
Biomedical voice measurements including Pitch Period Entropy (PPE), Recurrence Period Density Entropy (RPDE), and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) were applied to speech signals which detect tremors. 
The main question investigated is; Are voice measurements clinically relevant to track PD symptoms? Clinical relevance was determined by the correlation of voice measurements to the unified Parkinson’s disease rating scale (UPDRS) which is traditionally used by clinicians to track the progression of PD symptoms. 
We selected Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) to analyze the data. Findings revealed that using biomedical measurements helps to detect symptoms with UPDRS.
